# my final year project

A new Flutter project. Utilising Mitch Koko's template as a headstart, I aim to create an AI-powered virtual fashion assistant 

11 May Upgrades
- One of my final touches, where I made the dummy "Recommend Me" button a reality.

2nd April Upgrades
- one of my final touches and iterations, which include 
1. Dynamic Membership Progress Indicator (Rewards System) 
2. 'VAVA recommends' feature
3. cleaned up VAVA page UI
4. cleaned up Orders page

26th Mar Upgrades 
1. Added a mood board page, while cleaning up some UX/UI

19th Mar Upgrades
1. Did up the CartOut page by adding a few more features
2. Moving forward, the most important thing that I will need to do will be to settle my UX/UI experience and making it more seamless 

16th Mar Upgrades
1. Added Vava, my Gemini Chatbot. Functionality-wise, it works very well!
- However, one thing that I will need to sort will be the overall UX/UI, ensuring that everything looks seamless and good
2. For next steps, To-Dos would be to continue with what I mentioned and said on 15th March

15th Mar Upgrades
1. Accounted for saving Payment Details, as well as cleaning up my Measurement Page
- The subsequent thing that I will need to settle would be the CartOut page, as well as the parameters that go along with it, and the new features I want to implement
- Tip to myself would be to follow the format for the Payment Details Page for Shipping and Billing Address Page
- Group the parameters and save them as one Firestore entry, will be easier

12th Mar Upgrades
1. Added recommender_page which holds my backend logic for my auto-recommender
2. Did up the UI for the recommender function as well

6th Mar Upgrades
1. Minor Overhaul on the UI and backend logic, so that it works out for it being a Shirt e-shop
2. From here, next thing to incorporate would be the Recommender 

3rd Mar Updates
1. I created a chatbot page and integrated Dialogflow. However, the API does not call and reflect on the screen. Will need to see 
if I want to swap out the JSON file or continue troubleshooting
2. Added "Measurements" and "Profile Page" to obtain key details in helping us streamline workflows for our Users as a Virtual Fashion Assistant.
Next steps include Measurement >> Clothing Size recommendations, Change in Product Catalogue to fit this need, working on Payment Details 

25th Feb Updates
1. Done with Firebase Authentication feature for Login Page (Currently missing "Forgot Password" functionality)
2. Done up Cloudstore as my backend database to hold Order details for me, as well as an "Orders" page on the left panel
